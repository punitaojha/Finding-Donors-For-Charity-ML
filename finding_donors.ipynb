    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

In the real world, ideally your base model would be either the results of a previous model or could be based on a research paper upon which you are looking to improve. When there is no benchmark model set, getting a result better than random choice is a place you could start from.\n",

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "The list of all the three supervised learning Models that are appropriate to this Problem and we will test them on census data are :-\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Ensemble Methods- Random Forest**\n",
    "\n",
    "**One real world application in industry where the model can be applied :-**\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation Engine in E-Commerce . It can be used in E-Commerce to Predict Whether the customer will actually buy the product or not . Or what product is the customer more likely to buy . \n",
    "\n",
    "**The strengths of the model and scenarios when it will perform good :-**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The very common Problem In Machine Learning is Overfitting and this won't happen easily to a Random Forest Classifier . Thus Random Forest Classifier don't tend to overfit easily . \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Random Forest requires no input data preparation . They can deal with both numerical data and categorial data . \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Random forest usually do well with default hyperparameters and does not require lot of tweaking in the default parameters to perform good . \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Random Forest Run times are pretty Fast . It is fast to train . Individual decision trees can be trained parallely . \n",
    "\n",
    "5. The random forest algorithm can also be used for feature engineering . That is it can be used to identify the most important features . \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Higher Accuracy - Random Forest can make wrong prediction only when half or more than half of the classifiers are incorrect . \n",
    "\n",
    "**Some weaknesses of the model and scenarios when it will perform bad :-**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A large number of predictions can make the algorithm slow during predictions . Hence we cannot make real time predictions in Random Forest . \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Random Forest Is A black box model and hence it can't help humans understand the factors on the basis of which these predictions are made . Hence they are not human interpretable . \n",
    "\n",
    "3. It is more complex and also computationally expensive . \n",
    "\n",
    "**What makes random forest a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data :-**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Random Forest Algorithm can deal with both categorial and numerical data . As we can see in our problem set of 'Finding donors to charity ML', there are features like - age, education-num, capital-gain, capital-loss, hours-per-week which are continuous and others like workclass, education, marital-status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, native-country which are categorial . So as our dataset comprise of both Numerical and Categorial Datasets . Also with this we are clear that since the model has the capability to deal with both numerial and categorial data . \n",
    "\n",
    "2. As Random Forest Algorithm don't Overfit , it is in our favour to use such a algorithm for our usecase because accuracy is our primary concern as it is made clear in the Project Description stated under 'Software Requirement Section' quoted with lines \" Your goal will be evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent\" . So if our model don't overfit easily it is likely to perform better and yield higher accuracy . \n",

    "3. As Random Forest can also be used for feature engineering it will be easier for us to understand which features were contributing to the predictions made later . \n",

    "\n",
    "3. It is effective in high dimensions space . \n",

    "**Some weaknesses of the model and scenarios when it will perform bad :-**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It does not perform well when dataset has noise . \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Support Vector Machines have high algorithmic complexity and extensive memory requirements due to the use of quadratic programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Another limitation of Support Vector Machine is the choice of the kernel. If we make a  wrong choice of the kernel can lead to an increase in error percentage .\n",
    "\n",
    "4. It is a black box algorithm as it is not human interpretable . The complex data transformations and resulting boundary plane are very difficult to interpret. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. SVM doesn’t directly provide probability estimates, these are calculated using an expensive five-fold cross-validation. It is related SVC method of Python scikit-learn library.(Since we are using scikit learn it is worth mentioning this here . )\n",
    "\n",
    "**What makes Support Vector Machine a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data :-**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. As quoted in the getting started section of this project - \"The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries.\" As we know that we don't have missing data in our dataset or ill formatted data , this is an advantage for us to use support vector machines in this scenario because support vector machines perform good on cleaner dataset and hence gives better accuracy there .\n",

    "3. Decision trees implicitly perform variable screening or feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Decision trees require relatively little effort from users for data preparation.It deals with missing values by filling the most appropriate values . \n",

    "5. Decision trees is suitable for handling both categorical and quantitative values\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some weaknesses of the model and scenarios when it will perform bad :-**\n",
    "1. It tends to overfits on the training data and thus end up memorizing the training data and hence perform poorly on the testing data . \n",
    "\n",
    "2. In some cases decision trees turn out to be very complex . \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate. It is therefore recommended to balance the data set prior to fitting with the decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What makes Decision Trees  a good candidate for the problem, given what you know about the data :-**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Decision Tree Algorithm can deal with both categorial and numerical data .

    "\n",
    "2. As Decision Tree can also be used for feature engineering it will be easier for us to understand which features were contributing to the predictions made later . \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Again as quoted in the getting started section \"This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources . \"\n",
    "\n",
    "The above quote helps us understand that our model will be benefical for non profit setting organisations, who are trying to understand an individual's income based on which they will plan a cold call or more likely will shoot them an email to donate and not just that but also how much of donation to expect will also depend on our model . There executives who are making a decision to shoot these emails , it is equally important for them to understand how our model made that prediction and based on what factor it made that prediction . Since Decision tree is not a black box model , it is quite possible for us to explain the factors on the basis of which we made the decision . Thus the model is human interpretable . \n",
    "\n",
    "The added advantage of a model being human interpretable is not just making the executive of the company understand the criteria but also tweak the results as per human intelligence . Like suppose a feature which was pretty relevant in 1948 when our model was made but hold no relevance as of today and our decision in the prediction is affected by that the person or the executive making the final decision for the company can keep that in mind while making the decision and this can happen only if the model is explainable to humans . \n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Based on the evaluation that we have performed earlier , we will believe in 'Random Forest Classifier' to be most appropriate for the task of identifying individuals that make more than $50000 . Reason being , we are coming to these conclusions after analysing the above graphs .\n",
    "\n",
    "Before choosing random forest classifier as the best one . Lets identify how we concluded what we concludes . So to start with we did not start with picking the best one up but rather eliminating the worst cases first .\n",
    "\n",
    "So lets start with taking into consideration the training time for the testing set, we can conclude that SVC is taking the highest training time of approx 29 seconds . while RFC for 0.23 seconds(approx) and decision tree classifiers are consuming much less . \n",
    "\n",
    "So if we analyse and observe the time predictions on the testing set we can clearly discard SVC for our case as it is taking much more time compared to RandomForestClassifier and Decision Trees . \n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that when we use 100% of the testing set to make the prediction. The fscore of Random Forest Classifier is approximately 0.628 which is much likely to be same for SVC as well but it is nearly 61% for decision tree classifier . As per Fscore both random forest and support vector machines are doing good . Decision Tree is also performing slightly lower than SVC .\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus keeping Fscore and Prediction time in mind , we prefer to go for Random Forest Classifer because it has higher FScore and also take less time to execute . So it is win-win situation for us both from the perspective of time consumed and also Fscore . \n",
    "\n",
    "Also another reason for choosing random forest classifier over decision trees is it seems to overfit . Like we have 0.97 Fscore approx on training set but it has only 0.62 Fscore approx on testing which is lowest of all the 3 cases Fscore . \n",
    "\n",
    "If we also consider algorithms suitability for the data , we can say that Random Forest Deals with both categorial and numerical data , hence we can use random forest classifier for our case ."

    "We have created multiple decision trees of the data available . In each of these decision trees we will take different combination of columns . These columns can be picked based on our choices . Please note that for all the cases we need not take all the columns into considerations . We can skip some columns in some case and pick those in other cases . Also it is okay if we pick the same column multiple times in different decision trees but with a different combination . So we will form some unique decision trees based on what is available in the dataset . \n",

    "Each of these person now start brainstorming to get me pick the best one . So one of them is trying to figure out whether I would choose Veg or Non Veg . Someone tries to find out if I like vegetables and if yes what all vegetables and do I prefer tomato more or onion more . Someone tries to figure out if I like cheese or paneer and do I like Gold corn . With these kinds of different questions in mind they come to somewhat different and somewhat same conclusions in the end we unite their conclusions by voting for it and hence come up with some final conclusion . So each of these friends are picking up some selective features of their choice and by asking different questions they are forming their own decision trees .  \n",

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Of all the thirteen features that are available to us for each individual in this dataset, the five factors I believe to be most important for prediction are : \n",
    "1. Workclass \n",
    "2. Education \n",
    "3. Occupation\n",
    "4. Race\n",
    "5. Hours Per Week .\n",
    "\n",
    "The order of ranking for these best 5 features would be (The features with top most priority are at the top): \n",
    "**1. Education-** I would give the highest preference to the education of the person because the more educated the person is the more likely it is for the person to have access to better opportunities and generate higher income . So this is obvious that the person who have completed higher education may opt for executive level positions etc and may get more money . \n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Workclass** I would give next priority to working class because I feel that most countries pay more to people who are associated with Gov work class earn more than private workclass employee in a very generic scenario . Also we have placed education prior to workclass because choosing workclass is one thing but getting selected and hired in the one of your choice can involve a process of  competitive examinations where employees can be judged based on their knowledge . It is very likely that person who has more knowledge may likely to get selected . So education is the primary factor . Rather in what category a person will fall is influenced by education . \n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Occupation** First of all I would throw a point to explain that yes occupation would affect the annual salary of a person . Like suppose a occupation which has more demand and less supply is likely to generate more income for the employee rather than a occupation which has less demand and more supply . Also there are occupation which involve less education and less knowledge but more of physical work but does not generate good revenues . On the other hand their are occupations which involve more skilled work and less physical work but generate more income . \n",
    "Also we are priortized occupation after education is because education is influencing where a person will be in more or less skilled occupation . However the reason of rating workclass prior to occupation is the difference between Govt and Private Employees would create a greater difference in the salaries compared to the salaries of people in less skilled and more skilled profession .  \n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Hours per week** Yes this would affect the income because a person working for less number of hours would earn less and a person working for more number of hours would earn more . I would keep education and occupation prior to hours per week because education is the ticket to the person to get hired for more number of hours or less . Also if the person is into skilled profession and gets hired for less time but as the job is in demand he can end up earning more . But there will be less likely the cases on a generic basis where we have people who are hired on hourly basis and there will be more full month paid basis employees. ALso there will be more full time working people and less part time jobs .  \n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Race** - I would give Race Preference above all the factors we left below because the data is of 1994 US census so there are more chances of biased decisions on the basis of Black Race and white race . We have seen that the income and opportunities in the industries in 30% cases were influenced by biased decisions . We can so firmly say that it was influenced because it is now in the last few years that we have started to hear about campaigns for equal rights and equal opportunites . So we have started to combat the change of equal opportunities but it is not completely into practice . Some organisations have though adopted . But as in 1994 that was truely an influencing factor . Also still I would believe education, workclass, occupation would be prior to this . Because biased decisions can only influence judgement in some cases but not when a White Less Education (4th class) comes to stand a competition with a high grad black . The huge mismatch of skillset at higher package won't let the less educated on an opportunity . \n",

    "\n",
    "Observe the visualization created above which displays the five most relevant features for predicting if an individual makes at most or above \\$50,000.  \n",
    "* How do these five features compare to the five features you discussed in **Question 6**?\n",
    "* If you were close to the same answer, how does this visualization confirm your thoughts? \n",
    "* If you were not close, why do you think these features are more relevant?"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "* These five features are very different compared to the ones I discussed in Question 6 . The features discussed in question 6 are workclass, education, occupation, race, hours per week . The features obtained after feature_importances_ are age, hour per week, capital gain, marital status , education number . Though hours per week was one of it where I was close by . \n",
    "\n",
    "* I was not close to it . I think the above features(age, hours per week, capital gain, marital-status, education-number) would be more relevant . \n",
    "--> Age - I would feel age would matter because a person who is working for more number of years and holds more experience in the profession has more better skills and hence would end up earning more . So senior people into professions are paid more than junior people or fresher . \n",
    "\n",
    "--> Hours per week: this was one of the factors we have also taken into consideration in question 6. So I feel this is okay . Because People working for part time will be paid less and full time will be paid more . But if we compare of Age we feel that the difference in the income of senior people and junior people will be more compared to hours per week . \n",
    "\n",
    "--> Capital Gain - I feel that capital gain had a fundamental of the story from \"Rich Dad Poor Dad\" so there are people who get paid for working for the number of hours but there are some people who get paid even when they sleep . This could happen because they have planned their investments into assets nicely hence we feel that they would earn money when the rate of the assests are high when they sell . That is the price is high . So that would be a role with stock market . \n",
    "\n",
    "--> Marital Status - well I am not very much sure on marital status of the person . But may be people who are divorced are given more priority in getting exposed to better opportunities and they get reservation in good positions and hence end up making more . \n",
    "\n",
    "--> Education Number - I actually misunderstood the concept of education number, I related to number of years the person has devoted in education but this factor also holds a significant relationship with education so we can see that people who have done masters are scoring around 14 and who have done bachelors are scoring 13 High School Graduate is 9 and 11th is 7 . So I can now connect to the fact it holds a relationship with education and hence it makes more sense than education because it is a discrete integer number spread on a range of 0, 1 , 2 , 3 and so on a scale range and hence becomes more decisive a factor to contribute to how much income a person makes rather than education itself because integer are more decisive .

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

So I would say there is a slight drop in the accuracy score and Fscore when using with reduced data . \n",
